    <h1>Lifted Up Project</h1>
    <h2>What is the title of my project?</h2>
    <p>Art of the Savior through the lens of Code.</p>
    <h2>What am I going to do?</h2>
    <p>I will create a Python Code that pulls photos of the Savior off the internet and uses them to create mosaics of
      Jesus Christ and other gospel related images. I will then take a variety of these images and build a website to
      display each of them. I will share this website with my friends and family and encourage them to share it with
      others. There will be specific invitations on the website that encourage people to improve their relationship with
      the Savior and help others do the same. </p>
    <h2>How will this project bring me closer to Jesus Christ?</h2>
    <p>The ability to create is one of the greatest blessings we were given in this life. I will not only create
      something
      from scratch, but I will also be making something that constantly reminds me of Jesus Christ. I will also be
      inviting other people to draw closer to Christ, which in turn helps me do the same. </p>
    <h2>How will I make sure this is a significant project (not a hoop to jump through)?</h2>
    <p>Coding is something I really enjoy doing. This project will be something completely new to me, so I will be
      learning how to do it as I go. That really excites me and gives me an excuse to practice my coding. So by picking
      this project, I will not only improve my skills as a developer, but I will create something that I will be proud
      enough to show off. </p>
    <h2>What will the final product look like?</h2>
    <p>A website with mosaics of the Savior and other gospel centered images created through python. </p>
    <h2>What will I have accomplished on the project by March 15?</h2>
    <p>The python script to create the mosaics will be complete and I will have the framework of the website built out.
    </p>
    <h2>How will I grade myself? </h2>
